## How It Works

### For Employees:

1. **Install the extension** (one-time, 30 seconds)
2. **Open Salesforce** - Extension automatically starts tracking
3. **Work normally** - Extension is invisible, runs in background
4. **After 30 min idle** - Popup appears: "Are you still working?"
5. **Respond or ignore** - Click "Yes, I'm here" or let it timeout

### For Admins:

1. **View real-time status** in your work-timer-hub dashboard
2. **See activity updates** every 5 minutes
3. **Track idle/active time** per employee
4. **Export reports** (if you build this feature)

## Configuration

### Change API Endpoint

If your API endpoint changes, edit `background.js`:

```javascript
const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://your-new-endpoint.com/api/update-activity';
```

### Change Timers

Edit these values in `background.js`:

```javascript
const HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes (in milliseconds)
const IDLE_TIMEOUT = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes
const PROMPT_TIMEOUT = 10 * 60 * 1000; // 10 minutes
```

### Customize Popup Appearance

Edit the styles in `content.js` in the `showIdlePrompt()` function.

## Testing

### Test Activity Tracking:

1. Install the extension
2. Open Salesforce
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for messages: `[Content] Activity tracking initialized`
5. Move your mouse - should see: `[Background] Received message: ACTIVITY_DETECTED`

### Test Idle Detection:

**Quick Test (Change timers temporarily):**

1. Edit `background.js`:
   ```javascript
   const IDLE_TIMEOUT = 30 * 1000; // 30 seconds (for testing)
   const PROMPT_TIMEOUT = 20 * 1000; // 20 seconds (for testing)
   ```

2. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions`
3. Open Salesforce
4. Don't move mouse for 30 seconds
5. Popup should appear
6. Wait 20 more seconds without clicking
7. Check your database - status should be "idle"

**Remember to change timers back to production values!**

### Test API Calls:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter for "update-activity"
4. Should see POST requests every 5 minutes
5. Check response is 200 OK

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not loading:

- Make sure Developer Mode is enabled
- Try reloading the extension in `chrome://extensions`
- Check console for errors

### No activity detected:

- Check console for `[Content] Activity tracking initialized`
- Make sure you're on a Salesforce page (*.salesforce.com or *.force.com)
- Try refreshing the page

### API calls failing:

- Check Network tab for errors
- Verify API endpoint is correct in `background.js`
- Check CORS settings on your API
- Verify Remote Site Settings and CSP Trusted Sites in Salesforce

### Email not detected:

- Extension will prompt user to enter email manually
- Email is stored in localStorage for future use
- You can pre-configure emails if needed

## Privacy & Security

- ‚úÖ **No keystroke logging** - Only detects that activity happened, not what was typed
- ‚úÖ **No screenshots** - Only tracks mouse/keyboard events
- ‚úÖ **Minimal data collection** - Only sends email and status (active/idle)
- ‚úÖ **Local storage only** - No data stored on external servers (except your API)
