## Configuration

### Change Timers

Edit `background.js`:

```javascript
const HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // How often to send "active" status
const IDLE_TIMEOUT = 30 * 60 * 1000; // How long before showing popup
const PROMPT_TIMEOUT = 10 * 60 * 1000; // How long to wait for response
```

### Change API Endpoint

Edit `background.js`:

```javascript
const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://your-domain.com/api/update-activity';
```

### Customize Popup Appearance

Edit `content.js` in the `showIdlePrompt()` function to change colors, text, etc.

---

## Testing Before Deployment

### Quick Test (Reduce Timers):

1. Edit `background.js`:
   ```javascript
   const IDLE_TIMEOUT = 30 * 1000; // 30 seconds
   const PROMPT_TIMEOUT = 20 * 1000; // 20 seconds
   ```

2. Load extension in Chrome
3. Open Salesforce
4. Wait 30 seconds without moving mouse
5. Popup should appear
6. Wait 20 more seconds
7. Check database - should show "idle" status

**Don't forget to change timers back to production values!**

## Monitoring & Analytics

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Select `work-timer-hub` project
3. Click "Logs"

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Employee Questions:

**"Why do I need this?"**
- It's for automatic time tracking so you don't have to manually clock in/out

**"Is it spying on me?"**
- No, it only tracks that you're active, not what you're doing
- No keystroke logging or screenshots (unless you add that feature)

**"What if I forget to respond to the popup?"**
- You'll be marked as idle, but it automatically marks you active again when you resume

**"Can I disable it?"**
- Technically yes, but it's required for time tracking per company policy

### Troubleshooting:

Most issues are solved by:
1. Reloading the extension
2. Refreshing the Salesforce page
3. Checking browser console for errors
