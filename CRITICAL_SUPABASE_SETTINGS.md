# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Supabase Email Confirmation Settings

## The Problem
Users are being auto-logged in without confirming their email first.

## The Solution

You MUST configure these settings in your Supabase Dashboard:

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mkisayjvfcthkppiatmr/auth/providers

### 2. Click on "Email" Provider

### 3. Configure These Settings:

#### ✅ REQUIRED SETTINGS:

1. **Enable Email provider** - Should be checked ✓
2. **Confirm email** - MUST be ENABLED ✓
   - This is the critical setting that requires users to confirm their email before they can log in
3. **Secure email change** - Recommended to enable ✓

#### ❌ SETTINGS TO DISABLE:

1. **Double Confirm email change** - Can be disabled for simplicity
2. **Enable anonymous sign-ins** - Should be OFF

### 4. Save Changes

Click "Save" at the bottom of the page.

## How to Verify It's Working

### Test Flow:

1. **Sign Up** with a new email
   - App should show: "We sent a confirmation link to your email"
   - You should NOT be logged in automatically
   
2. **Try to Sign In** before confirming
   - Should show error: "Please confirm your email to sign in"
   - Should offer to resend confirmation email

3. **Check Your Email**
   - You should receive a confirmation email
   - Click the link in the email

4. **After Clicking Link**
   - Should redirect back to the app
   - Should automatically log you in
   - Should navigate to dashboard

### If Users Are Still Auto-Logging In:

1. **Double-check the "Confirm email" setting is ON**
2. **Delete any test users** from Authentication → Users
3. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
4. **Try signing up with a fresh email**

## Code Protection

The app now has **double protection**:

1. **Supabase prevents unconfirmed logins** (when configured correctly)
2. **App code checks `email_confirmed_at`** before allowing dashboard access

Even if Supabase settings are misconfigured, the app will:
- Check if user's email is confirmed
- Sign them out if not confirmed
- Show a message asking them to confirm their email

## Current Settings Status

Check your current settings here:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mkisayjvfcthkppiatmr/auth/providers

Look for the Email provider and verify "Confirm email" toggle is ON.

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the browser console for logs (they start with `[Auth]`)
2. Check Supabase logs: Dashboard → Logs → Auth
3. Verify the edge function is deployed: `npx supabase functions list`
4. Check if RESEND_API_KEY is set: Dashboard → Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets
