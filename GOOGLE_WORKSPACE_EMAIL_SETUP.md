# 🚀 Google Workspace Email Setup for PTO System

## ✅ Perfect Solution for Google Workspace

I've implemented **Resend + Supabase Edge Functions** which works perfectly with Google Workspace business accounts, bypassing all the restrictions!

## 🎯 How It Works Now

- **No Google OAuth required** - bypasses workspace restrictions
- **Professional email service** - uses Resend (trusted by companies)
- **Supabase Edge Function** - handles email sending securely
- **Beautiful HTML emails** - professional formatting
- **Automatic delivery** to fbayma@baycoaviation.com

## 📧 Setup Instructions (10 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Resend Account (FREE)
1. Go to **https://resend.com/**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (FREE tier: 3,000 emails/month)
3. Verify your email address
4. **Copy your API key** (looks like: `re_abc123xyz`)

### Step 2: Deploy Supabase Edge Function
```bash
# In your terminal:
cd /Users/david/work-timer-hub-1

# Deploy the email function
supabase functions deploy send-pto-email

# Set the Resend API key
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Optional - Verify Custom Domain (Recommended)
**Without custom domain:** Emails come from `noreply@yourdomain.com` (generic)
**With custom domain:** Emails come from `pto-system@yourcompany.com` (professional)

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **"Domains"**
2. Add your domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`)  
3. Add DNS records as instructed
4. Update the function to use your domain:

```typescript
from: 'PTO System <pto@yourcompany.com>', // Instead of generic domain
```

## 🎉 What You'll Get

### Professional Email Format:
```
From: PTO System <noreply@yourdomain.com>
To: fbayma@baycoaviation.com  
Subject: PTO Request - John Smith

[Beautiful HTML email with:]

- Color-coded request details

```

supabase login

# Deploy the email function

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Function not deploying?**
```bash
# Check if you're logged into Supabase
supabase status

# Try logging in again
supabase login
```

**Email not arriving?**
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery logs
- Verify API key is set correctly: `supabase secrets list`
- Check spam folder initially

**Google Workspace still blocking?** 
- This method bypasses all Google restrictions
- Emails come from Resend servers, not your Gmail
- No OAuth or workspace permissions needed

## 💡 Why This Works Better

- **No Google dependencies** - independent email service
- **Enterprise-grade** - Resend used by major companies  
- **Better deliverability** - dedicated email infrastructure
- **Professional appearance** - HTML formatting with your branding
- **Scalable** - handles high volumes without limits
